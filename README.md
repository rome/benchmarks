# Formatter Benchmarks

This is a simple repo for benchmarking the Rome Formatter. It's a separate repo because there's no
point in bloating the tools repo with all these submodules.

To run, please have [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine), [rome](https://github.com/rome/tools), and [dprint](https://github.com/dprint/dprint) installed.
